1. For cat x y > y, the content in x will cover the content in y when I tried it in the terminal. However, if there is no error, I think x and y contents will all show in file y
For cat x >> x, the content in x stays the same when I test in the terminal. However, if there is no error, I think content x will display twice in file x.
2.the scripts will allows a file to be able to execute. the scripts take 1 argument, and it allows the first argument file to be executable.
3.I use ls and wc to find out total number of files in the current directory.
4.I use ls -l to show all the files in the current directory, and the -S option let the files display in decreasing size order.
5.For this script, I had a little difficulty cutting out the name out of the output of groups [name]. The script will generate a whoson.log, and use the name inside the log file to call groups function each time, and write the output into file group.log.The file will display the content of group.log
6.I use wc to find the line of group.log, and return its value in order to find the number.
7.I take the arugement and check if it contains invalid characters for a variable, if not return yes, if yes, return no.
